# OceanSurvival (for Spigotmc)
A concept gamemode which start the player in a world of mostlty oceans. 
It plays on the idea that the world was flooded and the player have to survive
mostly from supply boats that float by until they are able to build a water (or island)
base and prepare for the deep dive and dig. Logs are placeable near the surface of the
water to encourage building in the ocean.
