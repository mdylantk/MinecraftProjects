TODO: decide on a way to build a raft. lilypad are the easist, but a bit odd. would need to line trace
to get a vaild location for placing wood. also a better way to detect vaild placeable.

also need to give new player a starting kit and maybe relocate them to a random spot
kit could be three type. a block to build a base on but nothing more.
or it could also have a fishing rod. it also could have some food and dirt and sapling for a easier start

also need a way to allow player to get items. boat with a chest (and fishing) are ideal
the boat with a chest would need a meta and maybe an AI or fake AI(currents) so it move
unloading, breaking, or even interating with it would remove the meta and maybe AI
unloading will delete it instad of just removing meta. maybe interacting with it as well...but
more on the line of breaking it
unless AI says active (then only player place boats will not be remove from save when unloading
The AI is simple. steady float in a global vector. maybe offset by noise. occasonly may slow down and stop
